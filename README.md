I mainly worked on PHP files and making sure that our front end can communicate with the backend, as well as minor details and useability of the website. I fixed a problem if there was one and if I knew how to solve it.

I worked on the main design of the html pages and most of the CSS for the project. I also worked on the PHP and functionality for various pages including the edit profile and sign in pages.

I worked on parts of the database and SQL queries as well as certain PHP pages in the site such as the Shopping Cart and Checkout functionality.
